# Moba Pulse


This is my personal project for learning more about PWAs and improving my skills regarding TypeScript. If you would like to use it 
feel free to do so. If you would like to give me feedback regarding the code base you are more than welcome to do so. I would be delighted.

## Running

This project depends on firebase for running the application. 

You will need the following environment variables;


* REACT_APP_API_KEY
* REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN
* REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL
* REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID
* REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET
* REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID

then you can start the app with `npm start`

## Deploying

To deploy the app you will need to use now.sh if you want to make use of the current set up.
